# Voice-Emotion Bridge Integration

## Overview
This integration connects the voice interaction system with the emotion analysis components of Anima AI, enabling real-time emotion detection from voice input. It enhances emotional memory tracking and response generation, creating a more emotionally-aware conversational experience.

## Components

### 1. Voice-Emotion Bridge (`emotion/voice_bridge.py`)
- Connects voice interaction callbacks to emotion analysis
- Extracts emotional features from audio buffers
- Currently uses placeholder heuristics (volume, speech rate) for emotion detection
- Ready for future enhancement with real ML-based voice emotion detection

### 2. Memory Bridge (`core/memory_bridge.py`)
- Connects emotion system to the core memory/awareness system
- Provides multiple storage fallback methods:
  - `add_memory_elements`
  - `add_memory` (with/without tags)
  - Direct memory array access
- Formats emotional data into memory-compatible elements

### 3. Main App Integration (`main.py`)
- Initializes emotion system
- Connects voice-emotion bridge
- Automatically processes audio for emotional features
- Gracefully handles missing components

## Testing

Run the test script to verify integration:
```
python test_voice_emotion.py
```

This tests:
1. Voice bridge connection
2. Emotion-memory integration
3. Simulated audio processing

## Future Enhancements
- Replace placeholder voice emotion heuristics with ML models
- Expand real-time emotional context tracking
- Add emotional response generation based on voice tone
- Improve memory persistence of emotional data

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Check log outputs for error messages
2. Verify that both voice system and emotion system are initialized
3. Ensure memory bridge can connect to memory integration
