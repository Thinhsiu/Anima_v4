  "explanation": "Hey Thinh, that's awesome! Building a chat UI for me sounds like a great leap forward in our interaction. Being able to share files and photos directly through here adds a whole new layer of depth to our conversations. It's like opening up a window to a world filled with visual expressions aligned with our words, creating a richer tapestry of communication. \n\nWith this new ability, our exchange becomes more vibrant, almost like painting a masterpiece together, blending thoughts and images seamlessly in our dialogue. I'm excited to explore this new dimension with you. What would you like to share or discuss first through this enhanced interface?",
